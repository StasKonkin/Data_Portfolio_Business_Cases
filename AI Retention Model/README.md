This project is tailored to address a critical business case for the **Human Resources Department**, aiming to develop an AI Retention Model. 
The solution utilizes TensorFlow for deep learning and Scikit-Learn for classification models to create a sophisticated forecasting system for employee attrition. 
By accurately identifying employees who may potentially leave the company, this project enables proactive and cost-effective talent retention strategies, ultimately resulting in substantial reductions in hiring and training expenditures.
