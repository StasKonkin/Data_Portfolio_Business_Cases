# "Retail Data Insights: Power BI, SQL, and Excel" 
A dynamic project where I used a real-world pizza sales dataset to create impactful Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and actionable insights.
Employing SQL, I expertly prepared and queried the data, with Excel ensuring its precision. 
The heart of the project lies in Power BI, where I crafted interactive dashboards. 
These KPI-rich dashboards tracked sales trends, optimized inventory, segmented customers, and monitored performance. 

_This project showcases how these tools synergize to deliver data-driven strategies for real-world retail challenges._
