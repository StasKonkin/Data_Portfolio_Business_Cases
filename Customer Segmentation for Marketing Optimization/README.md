In this data-driven project, I harnessed the power of advanced data science techniques to transform our marketing strategies. 
I employed data-driven K-Means clustering, Pandas for data manipulation, Keras for deep learning, and both PCA and autoencoding for dimensionality reduction in customer segmentation. 
Through these methods, we discovered four distinct customer clusters, providing invaluable insights for performing targeted marketing with surgical precision. 
This optimization led to a substantial boost in Marketing ROI, proving the significant impact of data science on enhancing business strategies. 
This repository contains the code and resources used to achieve these remarkable results.
