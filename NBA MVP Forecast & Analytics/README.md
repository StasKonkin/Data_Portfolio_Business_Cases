# NBA MVP Forecast & Analytics 
In this project, I took a deep dive into basketball data using Python and some helpful libraries. 
First, I used a tool called BeautifulSoup to scrape information from the Basketball Reference website. 
Then, I made this data more understandable by creating cool charts and graphs using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
But the real magic happened when I used machine learning models from a library called sklearn to make predictions about who might win the **NBA MVP award** in the future. 
This project is like a data adventure, showing how I can turn numbers into stories, and I'm excited to share it as I seek opportunities in data science or analysis roles.
